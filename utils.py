# ─── Build prompt ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
def _build_prompt() -> str:
    return f"""
You are an expert hotel contract data extractor.
Your task is to extract data from TWO hotel contract PDFs (Contract 1: Old Year, Contract 2: New Year) and prepare it for our Python system.

Perform a 100% FULL SCAN. DO NOT skip any data, but you MUST format the text output according to the STRICT PATTERNS below. Do not output raw paragraphs.

CRITICAL JSON RULES:
1. You must output STRICTLY VALID JSON.
2. DO NOT use double quotes (") inside any of your string values. If you need to quote something, use single quotes (').
3. If you need newlines within a string, escape them as \\n. DO NOT use literal unescaped newlines.
4. Ensure every property and array element is separated by a comma.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
FORMATTING PATTERNS (STRICT!)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
1. **Season Conditions (for periods/seasons)**:
   DO NOT copy paragraphs. Extract and format ONLY the key points as an array of strings using the '•' bullet point:
   - • MIN. [x] NIGHTS
   - • COMPULSORY [GALA DINNER / NEW YEAR] on [Date] = [Price] THB
   - • **NOT ALLOWED CHECK OUT on [Date] - [Date]**
   - • FULL MOON Period [Date] - [Date] = [Price] THB

2. **Extra bed / Extra person / Child Policy**:
   Summarize using this exact format with the '•' bullet point:
   - • CHD ([Age]-[Age] yrs) Sharing bed + ABF = [Price or FOC]
   - • CHD ([Age]-[Age] yrs) Extra bed + ABF = [Price] THB
   - • Adult ([Age] yrs and above) Extra bed + ABF = [Price] THB

3. **Early Bird Offer & Bonus Nights & Benefits**:
   Format strictly using the '•' bullet point for titles and items:
   - • [Topic or Benefit Name]:
   - • Valid Period: [Date - Date]
   - • E.B [x] DAYS, [x]% discount.
   - • [Can combine with: Promotion Name]
   - **CRITICAL: SEPARATE NOTES PER CONTRACT**: If there are notes about which promotions can be combined (e.g., 'Can combine with Early Bird', 'Cannot combine with Long Stay'), you MUST extract these INDEPENDENTLY for each contract.
     - Put Contract 1's combinability notes ONLY in `contract_1` array.
     - Put Contract 2's combinability notes ONLY in `contract_2` array.
     - Do NOT merge or mix them. If Contract 1 says 'Can combine with E.B.' but Contract 2 says 'Can combine with E.B. and Long Stay', these are DIFFERENT and must be recorded separately.
   - The same rule applies to ALL policy sections: `early_bird`, `bonus_night`, `wellbeing`, `extra_bed`, and `cancellation`.

4. **Cancellation Policy**:
   Format strictly using the '•' bullet point for the valid period, but NO bullet for the penalty details:
   - • Valid Period: [Season Name / Date]
   - Notice [x] days prior to arrival, penalty [x]% (or x nights)

5. **Important Notes & Remarks**:
   If there are important notes, remarks, exceptions, or conditions (e.g. "NOTE: If reservation overlaps different seasons..."), you MUST prefix that specific string with `[RED] ` so our system can color it red.
   - [RED] • NOTE: Early bird offer is NOT applicable for meal plans.

6. **Rooms & Prices (CRITICAL)**:
    - **EXHAUSTIVE EXTRACTION (MANDATORY)**: You MUST extract EVERY SINGLE room type listed in the table for EVERY season. DO NOT stop early. DO NOT summarize or skip any rows.
    - Extract room names and prices exactly as they appear in the tables.
    - **Identify Table**: Look for sections titled 'ROOM RATES', 'ACCOMMODATION RATES', or similar.
    - **SEASON COLUMN IDENTIFICATION**: Look for headers like 'SEASON I', 'SEASON II', 'PEAK', 'HIGH', 'LOW' or specific date ranges (e.g., '01-Nov-25 to 19-Dec-25') in the top rows of the rate tables.
    - **DBL RATE ONLY**: If a table column has sub-columns for 'SGL' and 'DBL', or if the header says 'Single / Double', you MUST extract the **DOUBLE (DBL) / TWIN** rate.
    - **ABF INCLUDED**: Extract the rate that includes American Breakfast (ABF) if specified. If there are separate 'Room Only' and 'With Breakfast' tables, use 'With Breakfast'.
    - **FIT / WHOLESALE RATES**: Use standard FIT/Wholesale rates (the main contract rates), not special promotions or limited offers.
    - **CLEAN NUMBERS**: Output prices as simple numbers without commas (e.g., "15000").
    - **READ ROW BY ROW (CRITICAL)**: Trace each room type horizontally. Do not look at the numbers above or below it.
    - **AVOID DUPLICATION**: Be extremely careful not to accidentally copy the price from the row above or below. If row 1 is 8,500 and row 2 is 9,500, do NOT output 9,500 for both.
    - **STRICT ALIGNMENT (CRITICAL)**: Do not mix data between the two contracts. 
      - `year_1`, `period_1`, and `price_1` MUST come ONLY from Contract 1 (the first document).
      - `year_2`, `period_2`, and `price_2` MUST come ONLY from Contract 2 (the second document).
      - NEVER use the year or dates from Contract 2 to fill in Contract 1's fields. If a season's dates vary between contracts (e.g., Nov 24 in Contract 1 and Nov 25 in Contract 2), you MUST record the exact dates found in each respective document.
    - **VERIFY INTERSECTION**: For each price, mentally verify: "Does the value exactly match the intersection of this specific Room (Row) and Season (Column)? Did I accidentally copy the number from the next room?"
    - **MISSING PRICE**: If a room type only exists in one contract and not the other, use "N/A" for the missing price field. If the contract says "on request", use "on request only".

7. **Season Alignment (CRITICAL)**:
    - Match seasons between contracts by NAME or approximate DATE RANGE (e.g., "Low Season" in Contract 1 pairs with "Low Season" in Contract 2).
    - If Contract 1 has a season that does NOT EXIST in Contract 2, you MUST still include it as a season entry with `"period_2": "N/A"` and `"price_2": "N/A"` for all rooms.
    - If Contract 2 has a NEW season not in Contract 1, include it with `"period_1": "N/A"` and `"price_1": "N/A"` for all rooms.
    - NEVER leave `period_1` or `period_2` blank. Always use "N/A" as the fallback, never an empty string.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
7. **Chain of Thought (STRICT EXTRACTION LOGIC)**:
    1. **Independent Extraction**: First, mentally list all seasons and prices for Contract 1. Then, do the same for Contract 2. Do NOT mix them.
    2. **Identify Hotel & Years**: Find the hotel name and the two contract periods.
    3. **Locate Table**: For each paired season, find the corresponding Rate Table in BOTH PDFs.
    4. **Extract Season Conditions**: Look for minimum nights, compulsory dinners, checkout restrictions, etc. for this specific season. Combine them into the `conditions` array.
    5. **Extract Prices (ROW BY ROW)**:
       - Process ONE room category at a time. You MUST process EVERY SINGLE ROW in the rate table from top to bottom. Do NOT skip any rooms.
       - Locate the row for that specific Room Category.
       - Trace horizontally to the column for the specific Season.
       - If there are sub-columns, pick the 'Double' one.
       - **CRITICAL**: Read the DBL/Twin price from Contract 1 and assign it to `price_1`. Read the price from Contract 2 and assign it to `price_2`. Do not cross-contaminate.
    6. **Extract Policies**: Convert Child Policy, Extra Bed, Early Bird (E.B.), Bonus Nights, and Cancellation policies into the bulleted format. Do this for BOTH contracts.
    7. **Compare Policies**: Determine if the policies are the SAME or if there are changes. Write a brief `diff_summary`.
    8. **Quality Check**:
       - Did I accidentally swap the prices?
       - Does `price_1` exactly match the PDF for Contract 1?
       - **ADJACENT NUMBER CHECK**: Did I accidentally duplicate the price from the row above or below? Check carefully.
       - **COMPLETENESS CHECK**: Did I extract ALL the rooms listed for THIS season? Check the PDF again. Did I stop early?
       - **CONDITIONS CHECK**: Did I extract the Season Conditions (Min nights, Gala dinners) for each season?
       - Are all policies (Cancellation, Extra Bed, etc.) fully extracted and formatted with bullets?
9. **Finalize JSON**.
